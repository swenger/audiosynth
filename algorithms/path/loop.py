# before: create automata
#         calc loops, which have no duplicate segments
#           consider the shortest possible loops
#           short loops should be extendible to the original path if needed
#         data structure of a loop: (length, cut-cost, [segments])

# idea: calc automata and a reasonable set of loops
#       calc shortest path from start to end/target
#       while the path doesn't meet the target duration (t > eps):
#            augment the path with a good/long loop (t_l <= t + eps)
#            increase the use counter of this loop
#       return path

# stephan wanted a randomized algorithm, which creates a set of paths and takes the best one
# choosing a loop is a random decision
