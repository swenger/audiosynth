cut search
- distribute cut points more evenly, suppress jumps of same duration

path search
- suppress back-and-forth jumps (handle non-jump cases with preference)
- hard constraint against repetitions? penalize short repetitions stronger? what about synthesizing long outputs?
- adhere to duration constraints better

results
- numerical experiments
