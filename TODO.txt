cut search
- distribute cut points more evenly, suppress jumps of same duration
- better suppression of diagonal paths
- achieve those points by searching cuts of specified length, not position
- suppress bad cuts (rhythmic misalignment) - possibly using a different error metric than Fourier spectra?

path search
- start from all start-to-end paths with forward jumps only and successively compose new paths from these
- suppress back-and-forth jumps (handle non-jump cases with preference)
- hard constraint against repetitions? penalize short repetitions stronger? what about synthesizing long outputs?
- adhere to duration constraints better
- genetic algorithm or searching for path with given length without cost function (repetitions?)
- reduce repetition penalty if repeated parts are long (and are more likely to go unnoticed)

results
- reproduce old results with GreedyPathSearch (remember to use same cuts), compare with new algorithms
