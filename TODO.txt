cut search
- find more cut points
- suppress jumps of same duration

path search
- suppress back-and-forth jumps
- hard constraint against repetitions? penalize short repetitions stronger? what about synthesizing long outputs?
- adhere to duration constraints better

results
- numerical experiments

code
- allow multiple key points
- cache cut search results
- nicer output format (plots, live visualization?)
