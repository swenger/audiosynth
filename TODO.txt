general
- stereo audio
- cache cut search results
- visualization

cut search
- find more cut points
- suppress jumps of same duration
- use MFCCs instead of FFT

path search
- suppress back-and-forth jumps
- hard constraint against repetitions? what about synthesizing long outputs?

results
- more numerical experiments

code
- clean up
- allow multiple key points
- command line interface
- nicer output format
